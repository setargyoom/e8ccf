Welcome to this site,

Previously, let us introduce the site managers consisting of Arif Fahru R, Alvin M, Azka Gibran, and Huda M.

Initially this site was created by one person on October 29, 2021, namely by Arif Fahru R. After being established for several months, then we intend to invite several colleagues to join and manage this site together.  The purpose of this site is to accommodate ideas and share knowledge about technology and others.

The name of this site is AyolahZy, which means (Ayolah) means an invitation or invite in Indonesian, while (Zy) is the name of a person, namely Arif Fahru Rozy (zy).  In the beginning, at the beginning of the creation of the site, Arif Fahru Rozy or as the initial creator thought that the name AyolahZy meant to encourage himself to consistently manage this site.

A brief story from me (Arif Fahru Rozy),

The beginning of getting to know the website / blog was in 2015, at that time I was still in 8th grade of junior high school.  At that time, during an ICT (Information and Computer Technology) lesson, a teacher told me to try to create a blog through blogger.

Together with other friends I also tried to create a blog with blogger.  I named the blog dolanbareng.blogspot.com (now the blog is dead), then for the first article I filled in on how to make roasted corn.  At that time I got the article only limited to copy and paste, edit from another blog.  You know ... at that time I was too new to blogs.  After that I just idled the blog.

But after a while I did not continue to manage the blog anymore.  I think I've been resting a blog for 4 years.  Well, in september 2020 I idly opened the blog, and it turns out it's still there.  Then I filled with articles about fish and their care.  But it didn't take long, because I was getting tired of why the blog couldn't be found on search engines like Google.  From here I started to lazy to manage the blog.

I'm still curious why the blog is difficult to find in search engines, then I tried to join several blogger groups on Facebook.  After time to time I finally understood that the blog could not be found in search engines because I did not register it in Google Search Console.  Well, oddly enough, even though I already knew I didn't even try to register the blog, and instead created a new blog containing a collection of blogger templates.  I also consistently fill the blog with various types of blogger templates, and even whenever I have free time I try to fill the blog.

Until the end of 2020, I even tried to create many blogs at once consisting of several platforms, namely blogger, wordpress, wix, zyro, xtgem, wapblog.id, wapblog.co, and medium.

However, instead of being able to manage the blog, what was there was that everything became chaotic and finally there were several abandoned blogs.  Until April 2021, there are several blogs that I am serious about.  A month later I started to be a little less consistent in managing the blog.  Right at the end in June 2021 I started to stop filling out articles on some of these blogs.  If you could say my weakness is not consistent in managing it and do not see the ability that I have to manage many blogs.

This July is a month that is quite strange for me, why at that time I even deleted the blogs that I had created.  What crossed my mind was that I wanted to create a new blog again, that's why I deleted my previous blog.  Including the blogs that I have been working on to fill out articles, I also deleted them, but I backup the articles first.

In August 2021, I tried to create a new blog again, then I filled the article with backup results from all the blogs that I had deleted.  Until now I still consistently manage the blog, hopefully in the future this can survive.

A few months ago, on October 29, 2021, I tried to create a new blog, which I named AyolahZy.  From the name, you can guess that the blog aims to encourage me to consistently manage my blog.  Some time later I invited several colleagues to join in managing this blog, which consisted of Alvin M, Azka Gibran, and Huda M. So this blog is still well managed and hopefully can provide benefits for everyone.  Thank you.

### The final word
We thank all readers, more or less sorry if there are words that are less pleasing.  Thank you, We hope you all like this site.  Have a nice day!  Good luck...
